PS: I am aware that exposing your API key like this should never be done in the real world. We use environment variables. Since this is just a practice project and is using vanilla HTML CSS JS, it's not worth jumping hoops and trying to hide the API key since it's a free and rate-limited one anyway. (I have tried to use env vars but it doesn't work so I didn't feel it was worth it)
